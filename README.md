### Genetic Algorithm

- The **Genetic Algorithm** was first published in the book by **John Holland** (Scientist, 1929 - 2015) in 1960. Since then it has been used to solve **optimization problems** across many different industries like engineering, logistics and transportation. 
- Although many other **optimization algoritms** have been developed in the year since, the genetic algorithm remains one of the most popular because of its simplicity and easy application to a wide range of optimization problems. 
- As the name suggests, the genetic algorithm is based loosely on the way **evolution** works in the nature.
